## A Little About Me
I am a self-taught programmer, always curious and willing to
          learn, currently focused mainly on the development of
          web pages and apps prioritizing accessibility, good
          practices, responsive design and a lot of attention to every detail. 
## Objetives
I am always looking to learn a little more and grow as
professional, I have taken several courses and programs to be able to expand
my tools and guarantee the solution of any problem I find
in the path.
